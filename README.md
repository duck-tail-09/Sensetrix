Experience a seamless digital healthcare journey with AI-powered insights, smart records, and patient-friendly dashboards.
Got it! Here’s a clear **page-by-page explanation** you can add to your README or repo description:

---

## **Page Descriptions**

### 1. **Landing Page (`index.html`)**

The landing page serves as the entry point to the ECR system.

* Features a **hero section** with an overview of the platform.
* Contains a **navigation bar** linking to the Dashboard, Patient Management, and Chatbot pages.
* Provides a professional and welcoming interface for users.

### 2. **Dashboard (`dashboard.html`)**

The dashboard provides a **summary view of patient data**.

* Displays key patient information such as name, age, and recent vitals.
* Includes **interactive charts** (using Chart.js) to visualize trends in vitals over time.
* Acts as a quick overview for healthcare professionals to monitor patient health.

### 3. **Patient Management (`patient.html`)**

This page allows detailed **management of individual patient records**.

* Shows a **table of patients** with relevant information like age, vitals, and medical history.
* Supports **actions** such as editing, viewing, or managing patient data.
* Uses a **JSON file** for sample data, which can later be replaced by a database backend.

### 4. **Chatbot (`chatbot.html`)**

The chatbot page provides **interactive assistance**.

* Users can ask questions related to patient management or receive guidance.
* Designed as a **standalone module**, which can later be integrated with an AI backend.

If you want, I can also **write a ready-to-paste “README section” combining all of this with repo setup instructions** so someone can immediately run your ECR system locally. Do you want me to do that?
